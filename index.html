          <p>India faced the highest per capita pollution exposure — or 83.2 μg/cubic metre — in the world, followed by
            Nepal at 83.1 μg/cubic metre and Niger at 80.1, according to the report which sources its data from publicly
            available sources
            </br>In 2019, as part of a worldwide survey, it was discovered that 21 out of the 30 most polluted cities
            were in India. And this pushed India's ranking as a country to 5th place, according to figures published by
            iqair.com. The US AQI number averaged out at 152 and the PM2. 5 figure recorded was 58.08µg/m³.</p>

        <h1>Pollution</h1>
        <p>Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials are called pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. They can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories. Pollutants damage the quality of air, water, and land.</p>
